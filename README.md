# Message-To-My-Senior
Evening Sir
Thank you for taking the time to read this

Harry, if you're reading this, I love you very much for putting me on the right direction and giving me the insight to become an engineer almost as good as you :)

## The Big Goal I Work Towards Achieving

After many years, and almost 1000 hours of commitment to this skill, I understand the fundamentals, thought I'm still a noob XP
I've finally been accepted into Turing and passed their tests related to my tech stack
To be honest, that was poes hard

### Smaller Goals On The Path
These are some of the things I plan on achieving

It's awesome developing Frontend systems that user's find amazing
If I develop something from the start, I'm going to use React. I started learning it when it was all Class based. Man, Hooks made it easy for new people...
For styling it's going to be SCSS with Tailwind
Tailwind for the boring old classes you need to create a decent layout, and SCSS with the BEM for custom styling, mostly for animations, because users just love that stuff!

I try to commit a minimum of 30-60 minutes every day to upskilling.
If it's worth doing, it's worth doing badly ;)
I ensure that I improve my skills by 1% each day. Some days, I improve by 2% :)

Everyone knows that African Proverb, I love my Proverbs
"If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together"

Sir, I would want to go as far as possible with my team

### Current Studies
I'm really keen on AI, I have a certificate on general AI knowledge and am currenly working on a certificate that focuses more on the technical side
Unfortunately, work has been getting really busy and it doesn't provide the most time to commit to this, but when there is Time for it, i invest into it
