# Message-To-My-Senior
Evening Sir. Thank you for taking the time to read this 

## The Big Goal I Work Towards Achieving

Sir, I know I don't have the proper skillset a company is looking for right now...
Companies are looking for Seniors these days...
(Data Analysis from looking at current job listings and from interviewing companies)

I'm only a Junior at this moment in time, Intern level on Fullstack and solid Junior, maybe even Intermediate, with Frontend

I want to work for you until I become a Senior in your company. That's my biggest goal as a Software Engineer...
I'd like to join a company and see it grow with the years.
I'm turning 25 this year, and a person usually retires at 65.
That means I have 40 years I can commit to you and your company :)
I don't want to hop company every couple of years (short contract basis sucks fat 'other-word-for-rooster')
I would like to commit to one company.
Work for a solid company and work for a Senior for so long that after a couple of years, when you have to do the handover to me, because you are retiring, you can hand it to your Senior Fullstack that was initially a Junior when he joined you :)

### Smaller Goals On The Path
These are some of the things I plan on achieving

I'd first want to have a solid grasp of Fullstack Web Development. I focus on the MERN stack, but I'll have to learn some C# since ASP.net is one solid framework for creating large scale APIs. I've worked at a company that uses the LAMP stack... quickly concluded that the MERN stack is much better for this age. MERN is for creating new systems, LAMP is for maintaining older systems

I'm also picking up some Python. The reason for Python is that I would very, very much like to work on Artificial Intelligence in a couple of years. And the path to AI is starting with Python. 
First learn some Python, then jump into Data Science using Python and after that it's the big doors towards AI

I try to commit a minimum of 1-2 hours every day to upskilling.
I ensure that I improve my skills by 1% each day. Some days, I improve by 2% :)

Everyone knows that African Proverb, I love my Proverbs
"If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together"

Sir, I would want to go as far as possible with my team
