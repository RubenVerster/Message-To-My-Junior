Hey there youngster ^-^
Thank you for taking the time to read this

Harry, if you're reading this, I love you very much for putting me on the right direction and giving me the insight to become an engineer almost as good as you :)

## You're Not Alone

Having a great mentor that can guide you and assist you into becoming an exceptional engineer is one of the best and most life-changing things that can happen to you
I know that a great mentor has given me some of the best boost I've required in my career
And I am hoping to provide the same help to you
I will always be availble to you to give you assistance and guidance to becoming an exceptional engineer, and it is a path I am excited to walk with you
I might be a bit tough sometimes and be a bit critical on code analysis, but it is for you to grow and become a valuable engineer ^-^
